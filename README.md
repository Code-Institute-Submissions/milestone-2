## Testing
Since you're wanting to test an API, my best advice to you would be to document any manual testing that you've done (making sure the API is connected, and making sure that everything appears as you'd like it when searching in the maps API) via written description and screenshots. It's completely understandable that you wouldn't use Jasmine due to the nature of your project, and I would recommend that you just document this in your README.


## Credits
In maps.js I largely used and adapted code found on the Google Maps Platform (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-hotelsearch).
I also integrated ideas used in an example website provided by Code Institute in my JavaScript document. This website was produced by Ben Hasselgren: (https://benhasselgren.github.io/ifd-milestone-project-pages/)
